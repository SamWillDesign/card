##  What was this project and how did I deliver it?
This project was a digital business card, connecting to my Instagram, email, and LinkedIn when I get my account working properly. I did this project through GitHub and Visual Studio Code, using HTML and CSS. 

## What did I learn? - What font?
Coding is a new subject to me so I learned how to use GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and the specifics of HTML and CSS to get images, fonts, logos, favicons onto the site and move them to where they belong.
I used the font "Lora", serif, and I downloaded it from Google Fonts. 

## Mockups - Accessibility
I used Illustrator mostly for my mockups, but I did use Figma a bit.
For accessibility, I changed the image that I was originally using for the background. I added a photo that was mostly black around the borders, with the sparkler in the middle as the subject matter. And used white as the text color, and the color of my clickable SVG.
